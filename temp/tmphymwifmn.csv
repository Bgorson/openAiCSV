The ACTIK CORE represents the higher end of what a good head lamp should offer. It's lightweight, plenty powerful, and includes a red light feature that protects your night vision. We also love the rechargeable battery, giving you the opportunity to be ready for your next trip with a quick recharge instead of a run to the store.

If all they have is a cheap lamp from their first hike or camping trip, this will feel like a big upgrade, and that makes it a great gift.

Spending a night outdoors in a hammock will have you wondering why we bothered inventing the mattress in the first place. They're extremely lightweight, yet far more comfortable than you'd imagine. You owe it to yourself to try one out. This model in particular is great because it comes with easy-to-use tree straps and can be set up in less time than it takes to find the right set of trees.

Up for a challenge? Lose the tree straps, grab some paracord, and learn to tie some knots. I recommend the bowline and taught line hitch for anyone interested in the craft. Check out this ~~ID=“100174” text=“handy guide”~~ for inspiration.
